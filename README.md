# Decentralized FundRaiser

Check out the demo: https://loquacious-froyo-6acd41.netlify.app/

## Introduction

To move away from my comfort zone and as an excuse to learn more about blockchain and smart contracts, I started working on this project with my friends.

- The frontend was developed using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS
- A fully-functional backend was created in Solidity to orchestrate the workflow
- To avoid any costs, we opted out for the thirdweb development framework for deployment

### Tech Stack

Solidity, thirdweb, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS
